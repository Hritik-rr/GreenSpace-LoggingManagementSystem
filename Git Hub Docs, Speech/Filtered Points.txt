A computer program that decides whether an image is a positive image (face image) or negative 
image (non-face image) is called a classifier. A classifier is trained on hundreds of thousands 
of face and non-face images to learn how to classify a new image correctly. OpenCV provides us 
with two pre-trained and ready to be used for face detection classifiers:

    Haar Classifier
    LBP Classifier

So we promptly discard irrelevant features and keep only those relevant with a fancy technique 
called Adaboost. AdaBoost is a training process for face detection, which selects only those 
features known to improve the classification (face/non-face) accuracy of our classifier.

WHILE TRAINING:
Detect our image, load our input image, convert it to grayscale mode and then display it


OpenCV provides us with a class cv2.CascadeClassifier which takes as input the training file of 
the (Haar/LBP) classifier we want to load and loads it for us for image detection.
