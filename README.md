# GreenSpace: Logging & Management System

Green Space is an python based project which inherently uses OpenCV which is the spine of this project, the concept behind our project is to provide a work frame for 
defining the real time usage of a computer vision :camera: by the means of building a system that can be used for the verification as well as identification.
If any person whose record is already present in the system then it will show the record otherwise it will capture the image of person and save it as unidentified which
can be further labelled.
